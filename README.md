# ToN

This has all the codes used in ToN paper
D >> VC >> delete a percentage of entries >> Recover VC 
generate a topology map and compare with the topology map generated from complete distance matrix

## Performance evaluation metrics:
1. Topology preserving error
2. Absolute hop distance error
3. Mean error
4. Count of non exact entries in the predicted distance matrix
